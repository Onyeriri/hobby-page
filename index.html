    <h2>Steve Jobs biography</h2>
    <article>
      <h3>Who Was Steve Jobs?</h3>
      <p>
        Steven Paul Jobs was an American inventor, designer and entrepreneur who was the co-founder, chief executive and chairman of Apple Computer. Apple's revolutionary products, which include the iPod, iPhone and iPad, are now seen as dictating the evolution of modern technology.
      </p>

      <p>
          Born in 1955 to two University of Wisconsin graduate students who gave him up for adoption, Jobs was smart but directionless, dropping out of college and experimenting with different pursuits before co-founding Apple with <a href="https://www.biography.com/inventor/steve-wozniak" target="_blank">Steve Wozniak</a> Steve Wozniak in 1976.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jobs left the company in 1985, launching Pixar Animation Studios, then returned to Apple more than a decade later. Jobs died in 2011 following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.

      <h3>Steve Jobs’ Parents and Adoption</h3>
      <p>Jobs was born to Joanne Schieble (later Joanne Simpson) and Abdulfattah "John" Jandali, two University of Wisconsin graduate students. The couple gave up their unnamed son for adoption.</p>

      <p>Jobs’ father, Jandali, was a Syrian political science professor. His mother, Schieble, worked as a speech therapist. Shortly after Jobs was placed for adoption, his biological parents married and had another child, Mona Simpson. It was not until Jobs was 27 that he was able to uncover information on his biological parents.</p>
      <p>
        As an infant, Jobs was adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs and named Steven Paul Jobs. Clara worked as an accountant and Paul was a Coast Guard veteran and machinist.

      <h3>Early Life</h3>
      <p>
        Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California. He lived with his adoptive family in Mountain View, California, within the area that would later become known as Silicon Valley.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a boy, Jobs and his father worked on electronics in the family garage. Paul showed his son how to take apart and reconstruct electronics, a hobby that instilled confidence, tenacity and mechanical prowess in young Jobs.

      <h3>
        Steve Jobs’ Education and College
      </h3>
      <p>
        While Jobs was always an intelligent and innovative thinker, his youth was riddled with frustrations over formal schooling. Jobs was a prankster in elementary school due to boredom, and his fourth-grade teacher needed to bribe him to study. Jobs tested so well, however, that administrators wanted to skip him ahead to high school — a proposal that his parents declined.
      </p>
      <p>
        After high school, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Lacking direction, he dropped out of college after six months and spent the next 18 months dropping in on creative classes at the school. Jobs later recounted how one course in calligraphy developed his love of typography.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1974, Jobs took a position as a video game designer with Atari. Several months later he left the company to find spiritual enlightenment in India, traveling further and experimenting with psychedelic drugs.

      <h3>
        #1 HE CO-FOUNDED A COMPANY NAMED APPLE ALONG WITH STEVE WOZNIAC
      </h3>
      <p>
        In the period of 1974-75, Steve Jobs occasionally met up with former high school friend Steve Wozniac, who worked at Hewett Packard (HP) Company. It was during this period that Jobs became aware that his friend was developing his own computer logic board and suggested that they go into business together selling it. A few months later HP formally turned down Wozniac’s design. In April of 1976 Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniac and Ronald Wayne founded Apple Computer in the garage of Jobs’s Los Altos home on Coast Drive. The primary objective of the company was to sell Wozniac’s designed machine which was named Apple I. The machine was little more than a circuit board and the initial business funds were generated by selling Jobs’s Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak’s programmable calculator.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wayne would leave after a short while, Apple Computer would become Apple Inc. and Jobs and Wozniac would go on to deliver massive hits in Apple II, Mackintosh, iPod, iPhone and the mac line of computers. The company would go public in 1981 with a record-setting stock offering, and in 1983 it made the quickest entrance (at the time) into the Fortune 500 list of America’s top companies. Apple would redefine the way we use technology, become one of the most powerful brands in recent times and more than 4 decades later would be the first US Company to be valued of at more than $800 billion in 2017 (Bloomberg).

      <h3>
        #2 HE DELIVERED THE FIRST COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL PERSONAL COMPUTER
      </h3>
      <p>
        Launched in 1977, Apple II was a major technological leap as compared to its predecessor. Jobs and Wozniac had sold about 175 Apple I in the previous year but Apple II was the first consumer product to be sold by Apple Computer. Jobs had convinced Mike Markkula (former Intel product marketing manager) who had put up a $60,000 investment in the company. The first Apple II was sold on the 10th of June, 1977 and it would continue to sell for 17 more years. When production ended in 1993, Apple had sold close to 6 million Apple II models including 1.25 million Apple II GS models alone. Due to this phenomenal success, Apple II series of home computers are regarded as one of the first successful mass produced microcomputer products.

      <h3>
        #3 HE INTRODUCED GUI, BUILT IN SCREEN AND MOUSE INTO A PERSONAL COMPUTER
      </h3>
      <p>
        Jobs’s unusual way of work and his ability to foresee a market made him a legendary business leader. The most notable example may be his visit to Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), with a group of Apple engineers, in 1979. This visit, according to some sources, was in exchange for permitting Xerox to purchase 5% of the company for $1 million. Highly inspired by the Xerox visit Jobs would bring the features to the new line of computers of his company. Jeff Raskin had started the Makintosh project in 1979 to design an easy to use, low cost machine for the average consumer and Jobs soon felt it to be the ideal product for his ideas. In January 1984, Jobs himself introduced the first Mackintosh midst a massive media campaign spearheaded by the now famous TV commercial centered on George Orwell’s 1984. The Macintosh, later referred to as Mac, was the first commercially successful personal computer that had a graphical user interface (GUI) and a mouse rather than the command line of its predecessors. This was a vital step that changed the personal computer industry.

      <h3>
        #4 HE WAS AWARDED OVER 450 PATENTS AS HE REVOLUTIONIZED SIX MAJOR INDUSTRIES
      </h3>
      <p>
        Steve Jobs’ ability to visualize, conceptualize and deliver path breaking products through his team and companies took the world aback and take notice. During his lifetime of work as a creative entrepreneur he focused on the “look and feel“ of his products and aspired for perfection in design. He was awarded close to 450 patents ranging from computers, touch based interfaces, keyboards, portables to staircases, clasps and sleeves. Along the way he revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing and digital publishing.

      <h3>
        #5 HE WAS BEHIND THE SUCCESSFUL ANIMATION STUDIO PIXAR
      </h3>
      <p>
        After leaving Apple in 1985 due to differences with the company’s CEO John Sculley, Jobs launched NeXT Inc. with $7 million. Although known for their engineering design, NeXT computers were not competing well with less costly alternatives from companies like Sun Microsystems. In 1986, Jobs put in another $10 million as an investment in the spin–out of The Graphics Group from Lucas film’s computer graphics division. This would later be renamed as Pixar. The idea was to leverage NeXT computing technology as a powerful rendering option for computer graphics. Although Steve had envisioned Pixar to develop graphics-rendering hardware and software, the business eventually evolved into an animation studio. The company, in collaboration with Disney, began churning out a string of hit computer-animated blockbuster films including Toy Story (1995), Toy Story 2 (1999), A Bugs Life (1998), Monsters Inc. (2001), Finding Nemo (2003) and The Incredibles (2004). Twenty years later his $10 million investment would yield him $7.4 billion and a place in Disney’s board of directors as the largest individual shareholder in return for Pixar merging with Disney.

      Steve Jobs inspirational quotes
    </h2>
    <p>
      <q class="quotes">Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower</q>

      A follower is someone who follows orders and a leader is someone who sets an example. We must learn the difference between the two and then decide who we want to be. If you want to be a leader, you must master the art of innovation. This is because you need to set an example to be a good leader and you will only be a good leader by setting an example with your actions and work. You are the one who must stay true to the statement ‘lead by example’ with the help of your innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <q class="quotes" >
        Some people aren’t used to an environment where excellence is expected
      </q>

      It’s a popular saying “we are a product of where we come from”. Well, there is another one that I believe in “we are also a product of where we are right now”. This means that if you hang around people who believe in an excellent performance, you’ll automatically be inspired to deliver an excellent performance. However, Steve Jobs says that some people aren’t used to such an environment. What he does here is very clever. By saying this, he is challenging everyone to be in an environment where everyone is expected to deliver excellent performance. It’s on you how to take this quote actually.
    </p>
    <p>
      <q class="quotes">
        Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn’t matter to me. Going to bed at night saying we’ve done something wonderful, that’s what matters to me
      </q>

      Steve Jobs wants to say that dying rich is not what matters to him, instead, he wants to feel that he has done something wonderful every day. There’s a huge difference between the two and we must always aim for the later. People will not respect you because of your financial status, they will respect you because of the wonderful things that you have done for the world. Work every day as if it is your last day and hence your last chance to do something amazing. Do this and you will go to bed at night as a happy person.
    </p>
    <p>
      <q class="quotes"
      >
        Be a yardstick of quality
      </q>

      A yardstick is a very long measuring device. Technically speaking, it’s a yard long divided in inches and is used to measure long objects and distances. What Steve Jobs wants to say is that our work must have quality. Being a yardstick of quality means being able to deliver the work that is extremely rich in quality. Nothing can stop you from achieving greatness if your work has quality more than quantity. Well, quantity is also important sometimes, however, if it doesn’t have quality and I mean good quality, then your work will not be that much praisable. So, we must always focus on quality first and then on quantity.
